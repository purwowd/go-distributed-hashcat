echo "🧪 Testing Clean Code and Capabilities Preservation"
echo "================================================="

echo "🔍 Code cleanup completed:"
echo "✅ Removed unused restoreOriginalPort() function"
echo "✅ No more Go linter warnings"
echo "✅ Clean shutdown logic with single updateAgentInfo call"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Expected behavior:"
echo "1. Agent starts: capabilities = 'CPU' (detected from hashcat -I)"
echo "2. Agent running: capabilities = 'CPU' (maintained)"
echo "3. Agent shutdown: capabilities = 'CPU' (PRESERVED - not changed!)"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Expected shutdown logs:"
echo "🔄 Updating agent status to offline and restoring port to 8080..."
echo "🔄 Preserving capabilities: CPU"
echo "✅ Agent status updated to offline with port 8080 and capabilities preserved"
echo "ℹ️ Skipping restoreOriginalPort() to avoid capabilities override"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Test command:"
echo "sudo ./bin/agent --server http://172.15.2.76:1337 --name GPU-Agent --ip '172.15.1.94' --agent-key '3730b5d6'"
echo ""

echo "✅ Expected results:"
echo "1. No Go linter warnings"
echo "2. Capabilities remain 'CPU' during shutdown"
echo "3. Database state: capabilities='CPU' (not empty) when offline"
echo "4. Clean, maintainable code"
