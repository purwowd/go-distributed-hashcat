echo "Agent 1 (GPU):"
echo "  • Resource Type: GPU (blue badge)"
echo "  • Allocation: 80% (purple badge) ← Hanya SATU percentage!"
echo "  • Assigned Words: 4 words (orange badge)"
echo "  • Job Name: job-name - agent-name (gray badge)"

echo "🎯 Key Points:"
echo "=============="
echo "✅ Hanya ada SATU percentage badge per agent"
echo "✅ Percentage dihitung berdasarkan performance score"
echo "✅ Total percentage = 100%"
echo "✅ GPU agents mendapat percentage lebih tinggi"
echo "✅ CPU agents mendapat percentage lebih rendah"

echo "🔧 What Was Fixed:"
echo "=================="
echo "1. ❌ REMOVED: Performance Score badge (getAgentPerformanceScore)"
echo "2. ✅ KEPT: Allocation Percentage badge (getAssignedPercentageForSelected)"
echo "3. ✅ ADDED: Clear legend for all badges"
echo "4. ✅ ADDED: Informative header with distribution logic"
echo "5. ✅ ADDED: Tooltip for percentage badge"

echo "⚫ Gray: Job Name Preview"
echo ""

echo "🧮 Percentage Calculation:"
echo "========================="
echo "Total Performance Score = 80 + 15 + 5 = 100"
echo "Agent 1 (GPU): (80/100) × 100 = 80%"
echo "Agent 2 (CPU): (15/100) × 100 = 15%"
echo "Agent 3 (CPU): (5/100) × 100 = 5%"
echo "Total: 80% + 15% + 5% = 100% ✅"
