echo "==========================================="
echo "‚úÖ Consistent: Same word count = Same percentage"
echo "‚úÖ Accurate: Percentage reflects actual word distribution"
echo "‚úÖ Fair: GPU gets more because it processes more words"
echo "‚úÖ Total: Always equals exactly 100%"
echo "‚úÖ Logical: User can understand the distribution"

echo "‚úÖ Word-based distribution test completed!"
echo "Now CPU agents with same word count will get same percentage!"
