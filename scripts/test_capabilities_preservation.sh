echo "🧪 Testing Capabilities Preservation During Shutdown"
echo "=================================================="

echo "🔍 Problem: Capabilities were being cleared during shutdown"
echo "🔧 Fix: restoreOriginalPort() now preserves capabilities"
echo ""

echo "✅ Changes made:"
echo "1. Fixed restoreOriginalPort() to preserve capabilities"
echo "2. Enhanced shutdown logging to show capabilities preservation"
echo "3. Ensured capabilities are not cleared during shutdown"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Expected behavior now:"
echo "1. Agent starts: capabilities = 'CPU' (detected from hashcat -I)"
echo "2. Agent running: capabilities = 'CPU' (maintained)"
echo "3. Agent shutdown: capabilities = 'CPU' (PRESERVED - not changed!)"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Test command:"
echo "sudo ./bin/agent --server http://172.15.2.76:1337 --name GPU-Agent --ip '172.15.1.94' --agent-key '3730b5d6'"
echo ""

echo "✅ Expected result: Capabilities will remain 'CPU' during entire lifecycle!"
