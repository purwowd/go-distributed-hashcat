echo "🔍 Problem: Capabilities still become empty when agent goes offline"
echo "Expected: capabilities = 'CPU' (preserved)"
echo "Actual:   capabilities = '' (empty)"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Root cause: Multiple updateAgentInfo calls during shutdown"
echo "1. First call: preserves capabilities='CPU'"
echo "2. Second call: restoreOriginalPort() might override capabilities"

echo "🔧 Solution: Remove duplicate updateAgentInfo calls"
echo "✅ Keep only one call that preserves capabilities"
echo "❌ Remove restoreOriginalPort() if it's causing conflicts"

echo "✅ Expected result: Capabilities should remain 'CPU' during shutdown!"
